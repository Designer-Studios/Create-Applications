# Create-Applications
Hi, this repository will be for creating .html files that can be used for testing and making work easier. 
Feel free to contribute and edit the inputed files. You are always allowed to add files as well as long as
it meets the standards of our policy. You can view the policy here: https://github.com/Designer-Studios/Create-Applications/blob/main/POLICY.
Oh! I almost forgot, if you want to try out the html files that are there already, you may:

Copy the code in one of the files
Then, paste it in a text document
Finally, change the file extension to .html and click on the file you have made
