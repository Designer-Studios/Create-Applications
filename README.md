Sometimes you forget your your ideas right? Wether it is a big idea that can change the internet forever, to
a small idea that can barely do anything. In this repository, you may take notes when you need them about ideas.
Please do not edit anyone's idea if they don't want it to be edited. If anyone edits, I will get an alert.
If you do edit someone else's notes however, I automatically save all of the notes in a private repository right when you commit one.




âš  If someone edits your notes, please contact me at this email: adamabdallah2011@outlook.com 
  If I do not respond there, please contact me at adam.abdallah3@icloud.com
